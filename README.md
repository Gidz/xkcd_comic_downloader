# xkcd_comic_downloader

A simple script to download and display the current day's xkcd comic.

I personally run it as a **cron job**. A good stress reliever on a stressful day.

## Usage
```
$ python3 xkcd.py
```

## Download Directory
This script downloads all the images to the Pictures directory in user's home by default

## Customization

### Changing the download directory 
Set the directory to environment variable - XKCD_IMAGES_FOLDER

## Operating Systems Supported
Tested this on MacOS and Linux. Will keep improving this.
